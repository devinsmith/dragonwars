# OpenDW Coding style

The coding style of OpenDW is not ideal. In fact it's more or less a rough
translation of 16 bit x86 assembly to C. Variables are just memory locations
and it's not always easy to to determine the scope of a variable. IDA helps
with this to some extent but even IDA could not fully disassemble this game.

There is some hope that with further reverse engineering of the game that
the coding style can be improved but for now the goal is to get through a
rough translation first.

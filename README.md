# OpenDW
A game engine for Interplay's 1989/1990 Dragon Wars game.
Original data files are required.
This game was originally written in 16 bit x86 assembly language running in
real mode. OpenDW is an attempt to port this game to modern environments using
the C language.

Original game engine by [Rebecca Ann Heineman](http://www.burgerbecky.com/).

This game can be purchased at [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/dragon_wars).

# Prerequisites
- Executable (DRAGON.COM).
- Original data files (DATA1 and DATA2).
- SDL2.

Under Linux/Unix operating systems, this engine expects that the original game
files should be all lowercase (e.g. DRAGON.COM -> dragon.com).
